we want to make it so that people can do the notes

- appendChild() will add a node to the end of the list of children
of a parent node, 

child is something to append 

> we need to do something like

ELT.appendChild(list_element)

if we have a ul element, we should be able to just append li elements but
and as long as we do textContent, we should be good?

// in local storage we should just have a list of these deck things
