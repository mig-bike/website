we want to make it so that people can do the notes

- appendChild() will add a node to the end of the list of children
of a parent node, 

child is something to append 

> we need to do something like

ELT.appendChild(list_element)

if we have a ul element, we should be able to just append li elements but
and as long as we do textContent, we should be good?

// in local storage we should just have a list of these deck things

- we can still use ul/li for the notes if we say list-style none,
i don't know if div is better

- use ::before pseudoclass in order to insert the checkboxes, background-size: cover, and background-position: center;
- add position absolute to image, add position relative to the to-do list.

in order to remove the element, we can do 

function(e){
    e.target.parentElement.remove();
}

we should also try this with the flashcards
