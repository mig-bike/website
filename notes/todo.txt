- Finish todolist stuff
- Delete note-taker thing (probably not useful)

1. Write flashcard review code
- Find way to review stuff that wasn't learned (store into unlearned / learned piles in flashcards)
- Do research on this kind of stuff
- Write stats file for it (tbh it might look better if timer / flashcard / todo stats can be in the same page)

2. Write CSS 
- Make stuff look better
- Find a cooler font and make it look minimalistic
- Maybe ditch some of the images?

3. Finish todo list
- Finish CSS for it, be able to cross out onclick of buttons

4. Write stats for timer / flashcards / todo
- Flashcards, do the # of cards reviewed / decks learned type thing, do streaks as well
- Todo, if we could do a thing with like number of tasks finished that would be cool as well.
- For timer, try to figure out if we can do a graph

5. Find out how to make it so people can download JSON files from our website & import them back into local storage or whatever
