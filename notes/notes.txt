okay local storage, (~10 mb)

- to create new item in local storage, we call set item method
and pass in two arguments (key for the item, value of the item)

- we can only store strings in local storage, so before saving to local
storage, we just have to JSON.stringify the value, and it should work well

- then in order to access it again we can just parse it!

okay, so for us, we need to do

localStorage.setItem('timer_stats', array_with_timer_stats);
or something,

- RETRIEVAL
localStorage.getItem(KEY) will just get it back,

and in order to convert it back is to just json. parse.

- if you want to retrieve all the values in local storage,

if you try to set an item that already exists, it will just override it (which we want actually)

we can also use session storage (but this will clear the data, which is something we might not want)


CUSTOM HEADERS AND FOOTERS

(https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_components/Using_custom_elements)

we need to stop rewriting the same code for everything. to do this,
we simply have to use some javascript to define custom html elemnents,

class customHeader extends HTMLElement {
  connectedCallback(){
    this.innerHTML = ' (insert html here) '
  }
}

and then, we can use
customElements.define(customname, class of element)
