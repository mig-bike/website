okay how would we even do this?

- first, +create new deck should go to a new page.

then we should have an input field for TITLE, DESCRIPTION, and then "add new card"
can also just be "front" and "back"

in general, the entire deck should be stored as an object, with

obj. deck = {
  title;
  description;
  array cards[];

  - we should also add stuff like 
  -> last_reviewed;
  -> bad_cards;
  -> good_cards;
  // cards should then store like a card, which for now will just be front & back (so array of 2)
}

okay, and then when we convert to json hopefully it should work

ok. so once they create a deck, they should also be able to edit it
-> this can be done by just going back to the input fields and stuff?

RENDERING

-> for each deck, we should create a "DECK" class box object thing
and then we can just put the title and description of that deck in there
for the main page.
** recall to add the edit button or something

ACTUAL CARD FLIPPING

once we have the deck we have to give them options to review it
- okay, so first of all we should go ahead and loop through every single once
in like 10 card chunks or so, until we get all the way to the end

- for each one, we should find out how to play an animation and flip to back,

there should be a couple buttons, all which go to the next card, and rate the understanding
of the card

for stat tracking we should be able to do the thing where they can track how many of each set 
they got right and everything like that...

so we have a plan,

1. add edit/start buttons to each deck (CSS)
2. make an HTML page for create new deck
3. make <form> elt and then on submit, save to local storage
4. figure out how to render decks properly
5. do the editing functionality for the decks
6. add review buttons and have it be able to loop through cards
  a. add html page for a deck
  b. make the buttons so that each one goes up one in the array
  c. allow review of stuff they mark wrong (store in other array, figure it out)
7. add stat tracking
